                <p>Props for the nav bar and React router were some of the tools I used
                    State and Emailjs were also used to make the connection part of the page, as well as Photoshop for some logo designs.

                Because it took so much work to deploy this website, I can make your website live using Google Cloud, Github Pages and other tools.
